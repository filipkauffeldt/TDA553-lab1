Task 5: Reflection

1.Explain how you chose the inheritance hierarchy in Task 1, making reference to the Open-Closed Principle.

The Open-closed principle states that software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
To make the code open for extension but closed for modification we chose to make inheritance hierarchy by using
subclassing. By using subclassing we could avoid code duplication. 



2.Explain how you implemented each of the sanity checks in Task 4.
