Task 5: Reflection

1.Explain how you chose the inheritance hierarchy in Task 1, making reference to the Open-Closed Principle.

The Open-closed principle states that software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
To make the code open for extension but closed for modification we chose to make inheritance hierarchy by using
Hierarchical Inheritance. 
By using a superclass Car we can make sure that code dublication dosen't appear and therefor we dosent have to modify
our different cars everytime we want to change somethings about the cars.

And by having a subclass we can extend our code by adding methods to the superclass and the subclasses can override the methods 
if we want the subclass to have its own implementetion.



2.Explain how you implemented each of the sanity checks in Task 4.
